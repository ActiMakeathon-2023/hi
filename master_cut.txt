Alarm Testing

Important Information



The following table lists the fault messages, warning messages and messages which are displayed on the
control panel but can be simulated only by program changes and are therefore not tested.





WARNING



	To perform a test procedure, it may be necessary to start the 	machine 	while the doors are open and the door contact switches are
	bridged.

	Safety functions are non-activ.

	Severe injuries may result.

	►	Only authorized/trained persons are allowed to run the machine.

	►	Special attention must be given and care taken when working in
		the danger zone without protection.



Please note that some fault messages, warnings or messages may contain a variable which is

generated e.g. from the servo drive or profibus and gives further information about this device. The variable depends on the actual fault and therefore may vary.
